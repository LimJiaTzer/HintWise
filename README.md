### üéØ The Problem Statement

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is creating a paradigm shift in user interfaces. While AI can provide instant answers, this convenience fosters a pattern of **passive consumption**, where users simply receive information without engaging in critical thought. This is especially detrimental in learning environments, as it stifles the development of independent problem-solving skills.

The challenge is to design a new UI/UX pattern that leverages the power of AI not as an "answer machine," but as a **Socratic guide**. We need to build experiences that place the human back in the loop, encouraging active participation and deeper understanding in an AI-native world.

### ‚úÖ Our Solution: HintWise

HintWise is a mobile learning assistant built entirely with **Lynx** that explores this new UI paradigm. It reshapes the traditional Q&A interaction into a guided, step-by-step learning journey. Instead of providing immediate solutions, HintWise encourages users to think for themselves by delivering structured, progressive hints, turning passive learning into an active, rewarding process.

### üí° How HintWise Rethinks UI/UX for the AI Era

Our project directly addresses the hackathon's goal of exploring how AI is reshaping app experiences by demonstrating several key AI-era patterns:

#### 1. ü§ù Human-in-the-Loop by Design
HintWise is fundamentally a **human-in-the-loop** system. The UI is deliberately designed to encourage user effort before providing more AI assistance.

*   **Progressive Revelation:** The core loop (Problem Summary ‚Üí Hint ‚Üí Another Hint ‚Üí Solution) is a UI pattern that requires user action and reflection at each stage.
*   **The 60s Cooldown Timer:** This is more than a feature; it's a UX intervention. It creates a "moment of friction" that prevents the user from passively clicking for answers and encourages them to genuinely engage with the hint they've received.

#### 2. ü§ñ An AI-Native Assistant Experience
HintWise is an **AI-native assistant** that acts as a learning copilot. Its purpose is not just to fetch data, but to guide a cognitive process.

*   **Reframing Intent:** The app's first action is to rephrase the user's question into a clear problem statement, a crucial step in agentic workflows where confirming user intent is key.
*   **Contextual Guidance:** Each subsequent hint is generated based on the original problem and the number of hints already given, making the assistance feel intelligent and contextual.

#### 3. üé® Generative & Dynamic UI
The home screen moves beyond static buttons and embraces a **generative UI pattern**.

*   **Endless Inspiration:** The four animated, scrolling rows are populated with thought-provoking questions generated by the Gemini AI. This turns the landing page into a dynamic discovery surface that invites curiosity and engagement, powered directly by the LLM.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built with Lynx: A Cross-Platform Foundation

This project fulfills the core requirement of using **Lynx as the UI stack**.

*   **Single Codebase:** The entire application, from the complex animations to the state management, is written once in a React-style TypeScript syntax.
*   **Native Performance:** Lynx allows these rich, animated UIs to compile to truly native components, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.
*   **Cross-Platform Ready:** While this demo was developed on a single platform, the Lynx architecture ensures it is ready for seamless deployment to iOS, Android, and Web, embodying the "build once, run anywhere" philosophy ideal for the AI era.

### üìã Project Deliverables Checklist

#### Development Tools
*   **Lynx Framework:** The core cross-platform UI technology.
*   **Visual Studio Code:** Primary code editor.
*   **TypeScript:** For type safety and modern JavaScript features.
*   **CSS3:** For all styling and animations.

#### APIs Used
*   **Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`):** Powers all generative content (summaries, hints, solutions, suggestions).
*   **Lynx Web Animation API (`element.animate()`):** Used for creating the smooth, performant scrolling animations on the home screen.

#### Libraries Used
*   `@lynx-js/react`: The declarative UI library for building with Lynx.

#### Assets Used
*   `logo.png` & `arrow.png`: Custom icons for branding and UI controls.
